## Overview
This application is designed to **detect and analyze non-stationary changes in ECG signals** using adaptive filtering and change-point detection algorithms. All graphs are specifically designed to work with and reveal non-stationary behavior.

## Graph Breakdown & Non-Stationarity Relevance

### **1. Unfiltered ECG Signal (Top-Left)**
**Functionality:**
- Displays the **raw original ECG signal** loaded from CSV
- Shows cardiac activity without any processing
- Time-domain representation: X-axis = Time (seconds), Y-axis = Amplitude (mV)
- Updates in real-time as you modify the signal duration slider

**Non-Stationary Relevance:** **HIGHLY RELEVANT**
- **Baseline Segment (0-50% of signal):** Represents "normal" cardiac pattern - stationary behavior
- **After Injection Point:** Shows visible shifts, distortions, or pattern changes when anomalies are injected
- **Key Indicator:** If signal looks different before/after change-point, that's non-stationary behavior
- **Example:** After injecting AR shift, you'll see the waveform pattern completely change

---

### **2. Noisy ECG Signal (Middle-Left)**
**Functionality:**
- Displays ECG **after adding artificial noise sources:**
  - **Baseline Wander:** Low-frequency drift (respiration artifact ~0.1 Hz)
  - **Powerline Interference:** 50/60 Hz electrical noise
  - **EMG Noise:** Muscle electrical activity (high frequency)
- Shows how real-world ECG signals are corrupted
- Only displays when you check at least one noise checkbox AND click "Add Noise to Signal"

**Non-Stationary Relevance:**  **VERY RELEVANT**
- **Noise Characteristics Change:** Different noise sources dominate different time intervals
- **Variance Non-Stationarity:** Noise power increases/decreases over time
- **Pattern Masking:** Non-stationary changes in ECG can be hidden by noise
- **Problem:** Makes change detection harder - this is why adaptive filters are needed

---

### **3. Filtered ECG Signal (Top-Right)**
**Functionality:**
- Displays output of **supervised adaptive filter** (LMS, or RLS)
- Compares noisy signal to clean reference signal and learns to recover it
- Shows **adaptive learning in action:**
  - Filter weights adapt to minimize MSE (Mean Squared Error)
  - Weights updated at each sample based on prediction error
- Displays algorithm parameters in title:
  - `LMS — μ=0.05 — M=2` (step size and filter order)
  - `RLS — λ=0.97 — M=2` (forgetting factor)

**Non-Stationary Relevance:**  **MODERATELY RELEVANT**
- **Supervised Mode:** Uses clean reference as target (assumes target is stationary)
- **Adaptive Learning:** If signal becomes non-stationary, MSE will increase
- **MSE Metric:** Shows how well filter is performing
- **Limitation:** Can't detect non-stationarity itself - only removes noise from current pattern
- **Usefulness:** Prepares signal for change detection algorithms

---

### **4. Error Power Signal (Pe) (Middle-Right)**
**Functionality:**
- Displays **sliding-window error power** from LMS/RLS predictor
- Shows prediction errors calculated by unsupervised algorithm:
  - Predictor: `ŷ[n+1] = w₀·x[n] + w₁·x[n-1] + ... + w_M·x[n-M]`
  - Error: `e[n] = x[n+1] - ŷ[n+1]`
- **Two lines shown:**
  - **Blue line:** Error power `Pe[n]` = average squared error in last L samples
  - **Orange line:** Adaptive threshold `θ = mean + K·std`
  - **Red dot:** Detection point where Pe crosses threshold

**Non-Stationary Relevance:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **HIGHLY RELEVANT - CORE DETECTION METRIC**
- **Normal Signal:** Pe stays low and flat (prediction accurate)
- **Non-Stationary Change:** Pe **spikes dramatically** when pattern changes
- **Why It Works:** When signal characteristics change, learned filter can no longer predict accurately
- **Detection Logic:**
  ```
  IF Pe[n] > θ THEN
    Anomaly/Change Detected at sample n
  END
  ```
- **Threshold Adaptive:** Automatically adjusts to signal properties
- **Example Timeline:**
  - Samples 0-1250: Pe ≈ 0.01 (normal)
  - Sample 1250: Inject AR change
  - Samples 1250-1350: Pe spikes to 2.5
  - Red dot marks exact detection point

---

### **5. Filter Weights History (Bottom-Left)**
**Functionality:**
- Shows **how filter coefficients evolve over time**
- X-axis: Sample number, Y-axis: Weight value
- Multiple lines = multiple filter taps (w₀, w₁, ..., w_M)
- Updated every 5 samples (sparse logging for performance)

**Non-Stationary Relevance:** **VERY RELEVANT**
- **Stable Region:** Weights converge and stay constant
- **After Non-Stationarity:** Weights suddenly change direction/magnitude
- **Rapid Fluctuation:** Indicates filter struggling to adapt to new pattern
- **Visual Proof:** Shows algorithm "learning" is disrupted by signal changes

---

### **6. Power Spectral Density - Unfiltered (Bottom-Center-Left)**
**Functionality:**
- Shows **frequency content** of raw/noisy ECG signal
- X-axis: Frequency (Hz), Y-axis: Power (dB)
- Multiple curves represent:
  - Clean signal baseline
  - Noise peaks at 50/60 Hz (powerline)
  - Elevated baseline around 0.1-0.5 Hz (baseline wander)

**Non-Stationary Relevance:** ⭐⭐⭐ **MODERATELY RELEVANT**
- **Stationary Signal:** Frequency content remains constant over time (classic spectrum)
- **Non-Stationary Signal:** Spectrum changes with time (requires spectrogram for full picture)
- **Limited View:** Single PSD averaged over entire window doesn't show temporal changes
- **Usefulness:** Validates noise injection worked (peaks at expected frequencies)
- **Better for:** Diagnosing signal quality (comparing before/after noise)

---

### **7. Power Spectral Density - Filtered (Bottom-Center-Right)**
**Functionality:**
- Shows **frequency content after adaptive filtering**
- Should show:
  - ECG peaks (0.5-40 Hz) - preserved
  - Powerline peaks (50/60 Hz) - **reduced or removed**
  - Baseline wander - **attenuated**

**Non-Stationary Relevance:** ⭐⭐ **WEAKLY RELEVANT**
- **Comparison Tool:** Highlights filtering effectiveness
- **Non-Stationary Insight:** If filtered spectrum looks very different from unfiltered, signal had severe non-stationarity
- **Averaged View:** Like unfiltered PSD, doesn't show temporal changes

---

### **8. Detection Results Panel (Right Panel)**
**Functionality:**
- **LMS Results:**
  - Threshold (θ): Adaptive detection threshold
  - Detection Index: First sample where Pe > θ
  - Status: "No anomaly detected" or exact sample number

- **RLS Results:**
  - Threshold (θ): Usually more aggressive than LMS
  - Detection Index: Change-point location (sample number)
  - Peak Trace: Maximum covariance trace value and location
  - (RLS specific: tracks P matrix diagonal trace for convergence)

**Non-Stationary Relevance:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **HIGHLY RELEVANT - FINAL OUTPUT**
- **Primary Purpose:** **Localizes non-stationary change exactly**
- **Interpretation:**
  - Detection at sample 1250 ÷ 500 Hz = **2.5 seconds** = exact change location
  - Compares with injected change point
  - Measures detection accuracy
- **Algorithm Comparison:** LMS vs RLS performance on same signal
  - **LMS:** Slower convergence, smoother threshold
  - **RLS:** Faster convergence, sharper detection

## Non-Stationary Detection Strategy

### **What is Non-Stationarity in ECG?**
Signal characteristics change over time:
- **Mean shifts:** Baseline wander
- **Variance changes:** Noise/artifact spikes
- **AR parameters shift:** Spectral/pattern changes (most important)
- **Transients:** Sudden events (arrhythmias, electrode issues)

### **Why These Graphs Detect It?**

1. **Graphs 1-2 (Visual):** Human can see pattern changes
2. **Graphs 4-5 (Algorithmic):** 
   - Error Power spikes when learned pattern breaks
   - Weight history shows adaptation struggle
3. **Graphs 6-7 (Frequency):** Show spectrum changes
4. **Graph 8 (Decision):** Outputs exact change location

### **Key Insight:**
- Adaptive filters **assume stationarity** in their training region
- When signal becomes **non-stationary**, prediction errors explode
- This error explosion = **anomaly detection**

---

## How to Use These Graphs Together

**Recommended Workflow:**
1. **Load ecg200** (default)
2. **Click "Generate ECG Signal"** → See Graph 1 (baseline)
3. **Set change-point position** (e.g., 1250 samples = 2.5s)
4. **Select non-stationarity type** (AR shift recommended)
5. **Click "Inject Change-point"** → 
   - Graph 1 shows discontinuity/pattern break
   - Graph 5 shows weights adapting erratically
6. **Run LMS Predictor** → 
   - Graph 4 shows Pe spike at exact change point
   - Graph 8 shows detection results
7. **Compare RLS** → Often detects faster/more sharply

## Performance Indicators

| Graph | Best If | Problem If |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| Graph 1 (Unfiltered) | Shows clear waveform | Flat/noisy (bad data) |
| Graph 2 (Noisy) | Noise visible but not overwhelming | Too much noise (obscures signal) |
| Graph 3 (Filtered) | Looks like clean reference | Still very noisy (bad filter) |
| Graph 4 (Pe) | Single spike at change point | Multiple spikes (false detections) |
| Graph 5 (Weights) | Stable then sudden change | Oscillating wildly (unstable) |
| Graphs 6-7 (PSD) | Clear peaks at ECG frequencies | No clear structure (noise dominated) |
| Graph 8 (Results) | Detection near injected point | No detection or far off |

### . Weight Vector (w)
The Weight Vector represents the internal coefficients or "taps" of the adaptive filter.

- What it is: In this simulation, the filter acts as a predictor. It uses the weight vector to calculate the next sample: [ o bj ec tO bj ec t ] y ^ ​ [ n + 1 ] = w 0 ​ ⋅ x [ n ] + w 1 ​ ⋅ x [ n − 1 ] + … .
- Relevance: It is essentially the "learned model" of the signal. If the signal is a steady heartbeat, the weights will settle into a stable pattern that captures that rhythm.
- Student Learning: By observing the Weight Trajectory graph, students learn how the filter "tunes" itself. They see the weights move from zero to a stable state (convergence) and then "drift" to new values when the signal changes.
### 2. RLS Matrix Trace (tr(P))
The Trace is the sum of the diagonal elements of the [ o bj ec tO bj ec t ] P matrix (the inverse correlation matrix) used in the Recursive Least Squares (RLS) algorithm.

- What it is: It acts as an Uncertainty Indicator .
- Relevance: When the filter starts or when the signal suddenly changes, the trace value is high, meaning the algorithm is "uncertain" and searching for the right weights. As it learns the signal, the trace decreases, signifying high confidence.
- Student Learning: Students learn that RLS tracks its own performance. A Peak Trace value at a specific sample often points directly to where the filter struggled most, usually right after a non-stationary change.
### 3. Inject Change-point (n)*
This is the "stress test" for the adaptive algorithms.

- What it does: It introduces a Non-Stationarity into the signal at a specific sample index ( [ o bj ec tO bj ec t ] n ∗ ). The injectChangePoint function can inject:
  - AR Parameter Shift: Changes the frequency content (spectral change).
  - Variance Jump: Sudden increase in signal power/noise.
  - Baseline Wander: A slow drift in the signal's mean.
- Impact on the System:
  - Error Power Spike: The Error Power graph will show a massive surge because the "old" weights can no longer predict the "new" signal.
  - Saturation Effect: The simulation adds a brief flatline/saturation to mimic a physical sensor fault during the system shift.
### Educational Takeaways
From these tools, a student learns the core challenges of Adaptive Signal Processing:

- Detection Lag: The time difference between when a change happens ( [ o bj ec tO bj ec t ] n ∗ ) and when the filter's error power crosses the Detection Threshold .
- Adaptation Speed: Comparing how LMS (simple but slow) and RLS (complex but fast) react to the same injected change.
- Algorithm Memory: How the Forgetting Factor (λ) affects the balance between tracking changes quickly and remaining stable during noise.
